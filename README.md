# Magic Carpet Ride
## Virtual ride through a forest on a magic carpet


This project was created as a proof-of-concept for virtual reality-based therapy. 
This VR app is designed to be used by spine injury patients.

The app can be used by a limited range of motion and allows patients to focus on gameplay to distract themselves from their pain.

In the game itself, the user rides a magic carpet through a serene landscape, complete with comforting ambient white noise.
The player can use the Google Cardboard trigger to collect fruit from trees. There is no focus on competition, the player is free
to look around and enjoy the virtual world as he or she wishes.

Note - This cannot be built as is. Google VR plugins are required to be installed as well.
